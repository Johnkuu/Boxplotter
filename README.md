# Boxplotter
Creates boxplotter from a csv- file. Includes a executable file and the script in py -file.
The .exe -file is created with pyinstaller
## This repo contains three files:
- Python script
- Executable file of the script
- Sample data file


## Instructions:
+ Save the exe -file to your folder
+ Save the data that you want to visualize to the same folder in csv -format
+ Execute the file
+ The program will ask for a title (give it one or donÂ´t, but you must press enter)
+ The program will visualize the data in two separate box plots (vertical and horizontal) from the data set.
+ A statistics.txt -file containing some basic statistical details of the data set is created.
